### v2.0

>>> During a practice routine, a guitarist need not take their hands off the guitar to get something everytime from the program. 
>>> Introducing a voice assistant MAC, who listens in background and accepts commands. Executes them in real time. No more convoluted if else statements. 
"A WIP."
>>> Once Mac is ready, implementing that framework into the Interactor program here.
