# Circle of Fifths

A practice companion for any guitarist to learn different musical components from theory and actively implement that in real time playing, while also capable of creating different routines and give structure to their practice.


### v1.0
- Contains all core musical files
- A fretboard generator
- Text based Interactor
- A question generator
- Utilitary functions

### v2.0

>>> During a practice routine, a guitarist need not take their hands off the guitar to get something everytime from the program. 
>>> Introducing a voice assistant MAC, who listens in background and accepts commands. Executes them in real time. No more convoluted if else statements. 
>>> Once Mac is ready, implementing that Assistant framework into the Interactor program here.
